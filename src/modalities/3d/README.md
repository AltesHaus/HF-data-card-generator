# 3D Modality Analyzer

## Implementation Overview
Analyzer for 3D datasets from HuggingFace Hub. Focuses on basic geometric properties without heavy 3D processing.

## Core 3D Analysis

### Geometric Properties
- Vertex and face count analysis
- Bounding box dimensions
- Basic mesh quality metrics
- File format and size analysis

### Simple 3D Operations
- Basic geometric validation
- Simple mesh integrity checking
- Coordinate system detection
- Basic volume/surface area estimation

## Format Support
OBJ, PLY, STL (basic loading and analysis).

## Analysis Configurations
