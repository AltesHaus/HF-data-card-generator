# Time Series Modality Analyzer

## Implementation Overview
Analyzer for temporal datasets from HuggingFace Hub. Focuses on basic time series characteristics and simple pattern detection.

## Core Temporal Analysis

### Time Series Properties
- Time range and frequency detection
- Data completeness and gap analysis
- Basic trend identification
- Simple seasonality detection

### Statistical Analysis
- Basic descriptive statistics over time
- Simple autocorrelation analysis
- Outlier detection in temporal context
- Missing data pattern analysis

## Format Support
CSV/TSV with timestamps, JSON with time fields, basic time series formats.

## Analysis Configurations

### Quick Mode
- Sample size: 500 time points
- Basic temporal statistics
- Simple trend analysis

### Standard Mode
- Sample size: 5,000 time points
- Full temporal characteristics
- Pattern detection
- Quality assessment

### Comprehensive Mode
- Sample size: 20,000 time points
- Advanced temporal analysis
- Cross-series relationships (basic)

## Time Series Processing
- Uses pandas for time series manipulation
- Basic statsmodels for simple tests
- Simple frequency detection
- Lightweight temporal feature extraction

## Temporal Visualization
- Time series plots
- Seasonal decomposition (basic)
- Missing data visualization
- Distribution over time

## Implementation Notes
- Avoids complex forecasting models
- Focus on descriptive rather than predictive analysis
- Simple statistical methods only
- Efficient handling of irregular time series
