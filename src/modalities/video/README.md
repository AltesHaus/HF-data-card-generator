# Video Modality Analyzer

## Implementation Overview
Analyzer module for video datasets including movies, educational content, surveillance footage, and multimedia content from HuggingFace Hub.

## Core Analysis Components

### Video Characteristics Engine
- Resolution, frame rate, and aspect ratio analysis
- Duration distribution and temporal statistics computation
- Codec and container format identification and profiling
- Bitrate and compression quality assessment with artifact detection (maybe)
- Frame count and video structure analysis with scene boundaries

### Visual Content Analysis Pipeline
TBC

### Audio-Visual Integration System
TBC

### Quality Assessment Framework
- Video quality metrics: PSNR, SSIM, VMAF for perceptual quality
TBC

## Format Support Matrix
TBC

### Container and Codec Support
Primary formats: MP4 (H.264/H.265), AVI, MOV, MKV, WebM with automatic codec detection. Streaming formats: HLS, DASH, M3U8 support. Professional formats: ProRes, DNxHD, MXF with metadata preservation.

### Loading Strategy
- FFmpeg integration

## Technical Architecture

### Video Processing Pipeline
- OpenCV and FFmpeg integration for video manipulation
TBC

## Visualization Components

### Video Analytics
- Frame sampling with temporal distribution analysis
- Scene transition visualization with cut detection
- Motion analysis with optical flow visualization
- Quality metrics visualization across temporal dimension

## Temporal Analysis Framework

### Scene Analysis (Maybe)
- Shot boundary detection using histogram and edge methods
- Scene classification and content categorization

## Error Handling Architecture

## Testing Strategy
- Multi-format analysis validation across video types and codecs
- Temporal analysis accuracy testing with ground truth data
- Memory efficiency testing with high-resolution and long-duration videos
- GPU acceleration pipeline verification and performance benchmarking
- Edge case handling: zero-duration videos, corrupted frames, unsupported codecs
