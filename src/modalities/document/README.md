# Document Modality Analyzer

## Implementation Overview
Analyzer for document datasets from HuggingFace Hub. Focuses on document structure and basic text extraction.

## Core Document Analysis

### Structure Analysis
- Document type identification (PDF, DOCX, etc.)
- Page count and basic layout detection
- Text extraction quality assessment
- File size and compression analysis

### Content Extraction
- Basic text extraction from documents
- Simple metadata extraction (author, creation date)
- Language detection of extracted text
- Document completeness assessment

## Format Support
PDF (text extraction), DOCX, basic HTML, plain text documents.

## Analysis Configurations

### Quick Mode
- Sample size: 20 documents
- Basic metadata and structure
- Simple text extraction

### Standard Mode
- Sample size: 100 documents
- Full structure analysis
- Text quality assessment
- Language detection

### Comprehensive Mode
- Sample size: 500 documents
- Advanced text extraction
- Cross-document analysis

## Document Processing
- Uses PyPDF2/pdfplumber for PDF processing
- python-docx for Word documents
- Basic OCR for scanned documents (when necessary)
- Simple table detection and extraction

## Quality Assessment
- Text extraction success rate
- Document integrity checking
- Language consistency
- Basic accessibility checks

## Visualization
- Document type distribution
- Page count analysis
- Text extraction quality metrics
- Language distribution

## Implementation Notes
- Avoids heavy NLP processing on document content
- Focus on document structure rather than semantic analysis
- Lightweight OCR only when absolutely necessary
